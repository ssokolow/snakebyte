While not yet usable on their own, this repository is slowly accumulating
components for building a reliable, featureful, easy-to-use, IRC file-serving
script in Python.

So far, the following components are ready:

- Round-robin queue with room to grow more sophisticated
- A command-line lexer interface with implementations for mIRC-style and
  POSIX-style tokenizing.
